    "in the scatter plots of NO2 you can see that especcially in the north west there is a much higher concentration NO2 in the air. but also in the south west there is a little higher concentration than in the east part of the netherlands. the seaside and the big cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam will most likely be the main reason for this difference.\n",

    "in the scatter plots of NOX you see kind of the same trends although the difference is here bigger in the windspeed of 5-15 area and the difference is smaller in the lower wind speed area.\n",
    "\n",
    "the scatterplots of the O3 are actually a bit different and you dont see a strong negative relation between the 2 factors. next to that you see that the wind speed at the 2 west stations goes further than the wind speed at the east stations. from there you can say that thats the seaside"
